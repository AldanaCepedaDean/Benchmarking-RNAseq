| Tool / Approach                                     | Type                              | Pros                                                                                                        | Cons                                                                                                                    | Recommended scenarios                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bowtie2 + featureCounts**                         | Alignment-based                   | Mature, widely used; generates alignments; flexible parameterization                                        | Retains many multimappers → inflated counts in repetitive regions; poor paralog resolution                              | Legacy workflows; need for BAM alignments; exploratory analyses                          |
| **STAR + featureCounts**                            | Alignment-based                   | Fast splice-aware aligner; widely supported; used in Cell Ranger; flexible parameters                       | Handling of multimappers depends on settings; often discards or ambiguously assigns; sensitive to incomplete annotation | Large-scale alignment pipelines; downstream analyses requiring BAMs or junctions         |
| **STAR + Salmon (hybrid)**                          | Hybrid alignment + quantifier     | Keeps alignments while benefiting from probabilistic quantification; good compromise between speed/accuracy | Sensitive to annotation quality; heavier computational burden than pure Salmon                                          | When alignments are required (QC, variant calling) but accurate quantification is needed |
| **Salmon**                                          | Alignment-free (quasi-mapping)    | High accuracy; probabilistic assignment of multimappers; fast and memory-efficient                          | No full BAM alignments; cannot resolve perfect duplicates; sensitive to incomplete transcript models                    | General-purpose quantification; repetitive genomes with extended annotations             |
| **Kallisto**                                        | Alignment-free (pseudoalignment)  | Extremely fast; good accuracy at transcript level; low resource requirements                                | Less flexible than Salmon; weaker handling of some biases; limited diagnostics                                          | Transcriptome-wide quantification; exploratory analyses at scale                         |
| **MMquant**                                         | Alignment-based read reassignment | Redistributes multimappers across compatible features → maximizes data usage                                | Risk of overestimation in pseudogenes/poorly resolved paralogs; less adopted                                            | Multigene family studies where coverage retention is critical                            |
| **STARconsensus**                                   | Alignment-based (haplotype-aware) | Allows haplotype-specific reference transformation; supports consensus genomes                              | Complex setup; not widely adopted; limited tools downstream                                                             | Studies with divergent haplotypes; allele-specific expression                            |
| **Graph-based pangenomes (vg, Giraffe, minigraph)** | Graph aligners                    | Reduces reference bias; integrates haplotypes/structural variants; handles diversity                        | Still experimental in RNA-seq; complex to implement; computationally intensive                                          | Future-proof for highly polymorphic/repetitive species; pangenome projects               |

| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cell Ranger (10x)**          | Single-cell pipeline (STAR-based)        | Industry standard; robust UMI handling; reproducible outputs; discards multimappers conservatively | Underestimates expression of repetitive gene families; STAR dependency; black-box nature | Routine 10x scRNA-seq; clinical/industry-grade analyses                    |
| **STARsolo**                   | Single-cell aligner (STAR-based)         | Transparent STAR-based pipeline; customizable multimapper handling                                 | Same multimapping limitations as STAR; heavier resource use                              | Alternative to Cell Ranger; when flexibility is needed in scRNA-seq        |
| **Salmon-Alevin / Alevin-fry** | Single-cell quantifier (alignment-free)  | Efficient UMI-aware quantification; probabilistic handling of multimappers; lower memory footprint | Relatively new; fewer downstream wrappers than Cell Ranger                               | scRNA-seq with focus on quantification accuracy; repetitive transcriptomes |
| **Kallisto + bustools**        | Single-cell quantifier (pseudoalignment) | Extremely fast; modular and memory-efficient; widely benchmarked                                   | Requires careful pre-processing; less user-friendly                                      | scRNA-seq at scale where speed and modularity are critical                 |
